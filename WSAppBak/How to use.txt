                'Windows Store App Backup' by Kiran Murmu
================================================================================

1] Enter the App path:
   ex. C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Disney.TempleRunOz_1.6.0.25_x86__6rarf9sa4v8jt
   Copy the 'Windows App' path which you want to backup, click on the left side 
   console icon and select "Edit" then "Paste" and hit enter.

2] Enter the Output path:
   ex. C:\Users\User Name\Desktop\New folder
   Copy the 'Output' path where you want to save the backup, click on the left side 
   console icon and select "Edit" then "Paste" and hit enter. Backup process will start
   immediately... this may take some time to make package.

3] A Window will pop up 'Create Private Key Password'
   Enter your password and click 'OK' then follow steps, or click 'None' button to skip.
   This process may take some minutes after that backup App is ready to use.

4] Use 'WSAppPkgIns.exe' file to install the backup App. Copy 'WSAppPkgIns.exe' from the
   'WSAppBak' foler and paste to 'C:\Windows\System32'. Now open the backup App (.appx)
   file using the 'WSAppPkgIns.exe', and make it default 'Opens with' program for (.appx)
   file.

*You must have installed Windows Store App license of the App to run the backup App.
*You must have installed 'Dependencies Package' to install the App. (You can backup
 dependencies package too)
*You must not delete any file from the 'WSAppBak' folder, or program may not works.
